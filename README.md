🔐**Key Logger Project (Educational Purposes Only)**\
-A controlled, exploration of key logging techniques designed strictly for educational purposes to understand how keystroke capturing works and the importance of cybersecurity defenses against such threats.

✅**Key Features**\
-Captures and logs keyboard input events in real time\
-Saves keystrokes securely to a local log file with timestamps\
-Demonstrates low-level event listening using Python's pynput library\

🧰**Technologies Used**\
-Python - language for key event handling\
-pynput - library used for monitoring keyboard input across OS platforms\
-Logging Module - for secure and timestamped keystroke recording\

⚙️**How It Works**\
-Listens to keyboard events asynchronously\
-Records every keystroke as a string into a timestamped log file\
-Designed and tested safely on macOS, with security best practices observed\

📖**Lessons Learned**\
-Gained hands-on understanding of how keyloggers operate at the system input level\
-Recognized the need for safe testing and ethical boundaries in cybersecurity\
-Developed an awareness of macOS security features like Accessibility permissions and how they prevent unauthorized key logging\
-Reinforced skills in Python event handling, file logging, and safe experimental setups\
-Highlighted the importance of removing software and cleaning up after testing to maintain device security\
